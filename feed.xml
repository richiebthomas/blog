<h2 id="-introduction">👋 Introduction</h2>

<p>Hi! I’m Richie, a CS undergrad with a strong interest in artificial intelligence. I landed an internship at SproutsAI as an <strong>AI/ML Intern</strong>, where I collaborated on a live product and explored hands-on applications of NLP.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-how-i-got-the-internship">🎯 How I Got the Internship</h2>

<p>I applied directly through AngelList, where the role aligned perfectly with my skillset and interests. After a small take-home assignment and a virtual interview focused on Python and ML basics, I was selected.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-what-i-worked-on">💼 What I Worked On</h2>

<h3 id="-smart-email-classifier-for-support-tickets">📨 Smart Email Classifier for Support Tickets</h3>

<p>I built a machine learning model to automatically classify incoming customer support emails based on topic and urgency. Here’s what I did:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Cleaned and preprocessed 10k+ real email samples</li>
  <li>Fine-tuned a BERT-based model using HuggingFace</li>
  <li>Deployed the model as an API with Flask</li>
  <li>Integrated the API into the support dashboard</li>
  <li>Monitored performance using TensorBoard</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Stack:</strong> Python, PyTorch, scikit-learn, Flask, GitHub Actions, Docker</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-key-learnings">🧠 Key Learnings</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Building and deploying an end-to-end ML pipeline</li>
  <li>Communicating technical details with non-tech team members</li>
  <li>Handling noisy data and unbalanced classes</li>
  <li>Importance of reproducibility and clean Git practices</li>
</ul>

<hr />

<h2 id="-challenges-faced">🧩 Challenges Faced</h2>

<p>One major challenge was dealing with <strong>class imbalance</strong> in the data. Most emails were low-priority, which skewed results. I applied oversampling, adjusted class weights, and improved F1 score significantly.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-reflections">🌱 Reflections</h2>

<p>This internship made me appreciate that machine learning isn’t just about models—it’s about solving real problems with constraints, timelines, and people in mind. It sharpened both my coding and soft skills.</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="-thank-you">🙏 Thank You!</h2>

<p>A huge thanks to my mentor Ananya and the SproutsAI team for their guidance and trust. This experience has reaffirmed my passion for applied AI and given me the confidence to pursue more complex problems ahead.</p>
