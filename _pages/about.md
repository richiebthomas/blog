![Richie Thomas](/blog/assets/images/richie.png)

Hi, I’m **Richie B. Thomas**, a final-year Information Technology undergraduate at Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, India. I build things that solve real problems — whether it’s a hardware-accelerated AI system on an FPGA, a gamified mobile app, or a full-stack web platform built under tight deadlines.

## Who am I?

I’m someone who prefers *making* over just learning. From my very first internship, I’ve been more excited by shipping products than by ticking boxes. Over time, I’ve worked with startups and academic labs to explore the entire software development lifecycle — from whiteboarding architecture to deploying real-world applications.

Outside of code, I enjoy simplifying things — building smooth user experiences, writing clean documentation, and making tech more accessible to others.

## What I've Done

Over the past two years, I’ve done **5 internships**, each giving me exposure to different technologies, workflows, and responsibilities:

- **IISER Mohali (Research Intern)** – Built a sparse neural network accelerator on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board, achieving 96% accuracy on MNIST. Got my first taste of edge AI deployment and hardware-software co-design.
- **Sports Mentoring Infusion** – Created a React Native + Node.js app for mentoring sports students. Integrated habit tracking and gamification features to boost user engagement by 65%.
- **GetFly Technologies** – Developed a campus ERP system using Flutter for a college with 1,000+ students. Unified multiple codebases into a scalable solution.
- **Bayside Sports** – Delivered a React.js + Laravel SSR web platform that improved page load and booking flows, helping convert users faster.
- **FCRIT (PHP Developer)** – My first major solo project. I developed a fully functional RBAC-based campus management system still in use at my college.

Each of these experiences taught me how to work with real users, real bugs, and real deadlines.

## Projects That Represent Me

Some of the projects I’ve enjoyed working on:

- **Investment Platform (MERN Stack)** – Built during a 24-hour hackathon. Supports portfolio tracking and auto-trading with real-time WebSockets.
- **Learning Management System** – A Flutter app with Firebase backend for managing content and assessments.

## Why I Built This Blog

This blog is my digital home. I wanted a space to:

- Reflect on things I’ve built
- Documentation
- Track my journey toward higher studies and a research-backed career in tech

The theme is based on the beautiful [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) Jekyll template and enhanced with [tail](https://github.com/jitinnair1/tail) for easier customization and deployment. I wanted something minimal, fast, and easy to maintain.
