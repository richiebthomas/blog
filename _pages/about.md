![Richie Thomas](/blog/assets/images/richie.png){:style="width:50%;"}

Hi, Iâ€™m **Richie B. Thomas**, a final-year Information Technology undergraduate at Fr. C. Rodrigues Institute of Technology, India. I build things that solve real problems.

## Who am I?

Iâ€™m someone who prefers *making* over just learning. From my very first internship, Iâ€™ve been more excited by shipping products than by ticking boxes. Over time, Iâ€™ve worked with startups and academic labs to explore the entire software development lifecycle â€” from whiteboarding architecture to deploying real-world applications.

Outside of code, I enjoy simplifying things â€” building smooth user experiences, writing clean documentation, and making tech more accessible to others.

## What I've Done

Over the past two years, Iâ€™ve done **5 internships**, each giving me exposure to different technologies, workflows, and responsibilities:

- **IISER Mohali (Research Intern)** â€“ Built a sparse neural network accelerator on the PYNQ-Z2 FPGA board, achieving 96% accuracy on MNIST. Got my first taste of edge AI deployment and hardware-software co-design.
- **Sports Mentoring Infusion** â€“ Created a React Native + Node.js app for mentoring sports students. Integrated habit tracking and gamification features to boost user engagement by 65%.
- **GetFly Technologies** â€“ Developed a campus ERP system using Flutter for a college with 1,000+ students. Unified multiple codebases into a scalable solution.
- **Bayside Sports** â€“ Delivered a React.js + Laravel SSR web platform that improved page load and booking flows, helping convert users faster.
- **FCRIT (PHP Developer)** â€“ My first major project. I maintained a fully functional RBAC-based campus management system still in use at my college.

Each of these experiences taught me how to work with real users, real bugs, and real deadlines.

## Why I Built This Blog

This blog is my digital home. I wanted a space to:

- Reflect on things Iâ€™ve built
- Documentation
- Track my journey toward higher studies and a research-backed career in tech

The theme is based on the beautiful [Tale](https://github.com/chesterhow/tale) Jekyll template and enhanced with [tail](https://github.com/jitinnair1/tail) for easier customization and deployment. I wanted something minimal, fast, and easy to maintain.
